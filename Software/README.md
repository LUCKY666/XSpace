# Unity + Oculus + LeapMotion + Arduino

Software Team have learned a lot with this new experience. This was the first time, that we connect several devices and a graphic engine to gain our purpose.

At the beginning of the challenge we didnÂ´t know how can we connect every piece. Moreover we needed a powerful PC to work with Oculus and we carry one. But it was neccesary to reinstall every program.

At first, we connect our working devices Leapmotion and Oculus in order to assure that our system can easily operate.
We readed a lot of documentation on Saturday to understand how can we stablish a succesful commmunication between the VR Environment and Arduino Nano in order to move our chair actuators.

We readed at first how can we stablish a Serial Port communication with Arduino and Unity. This was the most difficult part, because we obtained som errors with communication port devices, and this case was the key for this project.

Sometimes is better to begin a simple project from scratch, because our errors begin always with copy/paste projects.

At finnaly we gained communication and provide us some breath to continue.

We model our scenario with free unity assets from NASA and we use the lunar module Apollo 11 to travel over the moon surface.

</ul>

Some skyboxes were very useful to obtain more realism on the environment. Moreover we add some audio samples on the game, like astronaut breath, motor noise, and some others. 
This audio assets are on our ![Audio Assets Folder](https://github.com/dlabs-co/XSpace/tree/master/Software/Unity/AudioAssets)

Our first idea was transport a person to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTBIr65cL_E">moon landing </a> in a 3D environment, and feel like a person was on the suit travelling over it.

The results were succesful enough for 36 hours. How much can we gain if we had more time? We work o it.

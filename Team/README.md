#Team

Our team is divided in two subteams. <b>Hardware</b> and <b>Software</b>, but we enjoy time together.

<h1>Software Team</h1>
At the beginning of the challenge we didnÂ´t know how can we connect every piece. Moreover we needed a powerful PC to work with Oculus and we carry one. But it was neccesary to reinstall every program. And Finally we had every single piece that works properly with our solution. We seem like professionals in software development.

Software Team have learned a lot with this new experience. This was the first time, that we connect several devices and a graphic engine to gain our purpose.
